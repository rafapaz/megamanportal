Megaman Portal
A simple 2D game platform that mix the megaman 8 bits with the Valve Portal puzzle idea. Made in C++ with Allegro 5.0 library.

This is my first game, made for learning goals. I wrote this code to pratice the basic game development concepts while watching Allegro 5.0 Tutorial videos from <http://codingmadeeasy.ca/tutorialLayout/allegro5>.

Only tested in Linux. To compile, download the package, extract it and run "make" at the "src" folder.

Dependencies:
Go to the link and follow the steps to install Allegro: <http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian>

The maps can be created in a easy way. Just open the files L1.txt, L2.txt, etc... and follow the same pattern. More explanations soon...

Enjoy!
